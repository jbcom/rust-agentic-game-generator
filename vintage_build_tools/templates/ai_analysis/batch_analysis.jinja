{# AI Analysis Template for Batch Game Processing #}
Analyze the following {{ games|length }} vintage video games from 1980-1995. For each game, provide deep analysis across multiple dimensions. Your analysis should capture the essence of what made each game special, innovative, and memorable.

GAMES TO ANALYZE:
{% for game in games %}
==================
Game #{{ loop.index }}: {{ game.name }}
Year: {{ game.year }}
Genre: {{ game.genre }}
Developer: {{ game.developer if game.developer else "Unknown" }}
Platforms: {{ game.platforms|join(", ") if game.platforms else "Unknown" }}
Description: {{ game.deck if game.deck else "No description available" }}
==================
{% endfor %}

For each game, provide a comprehensive analysis in the following JSON structure:

ANALYSIS GUIDELINES:

1. **Themes**: Identify 3-8 core themes that define the game's essence. Consider both explicit themes (what the game is about) and implicit themes (what the game makes players feel or think about).

2. **Mechanics**: List 2-6 core mechanics. For each, assess:
   - Importance: How central is this mechanic to the core experience?
   - Innovation: Was this mechanic novel at the time or a refinement of existing ideas?

3. **Cultural Impact**: Consider the game's influence on:
   - Gaming culture and communities
   - Popular culture references
   - Industry trends and development practices
   - Player expectations and preferences

4. **Design Philosophy**: Analyze the underlying design principles:
   - What were the designers trying to achieve?
   - What trade-offs did they make?
   - How did technical limitations shape the design?

5. **Era Significance**: Place the game in its historical context:
   - What made it stand out in {{ analysis_date[:4] }}?
   - How did it push boundaries or set new standards?
   - What contemporary games was it competing with?

6. **Technical Achievements**: Focus on innovations relevant to the era:
   - Graphics techniques (sprite scaling, parallax scrolling, Mode 7, etc.)
   - Sound capabilities (FM synthesis, sample playback, etc.)
   - Game engine features (physics, AI, procedural generation)
   - Performance optimizations

7. **Embeddings**: Generate meaningful 384-dimensional embeddings that capture:
   - Semantic meaning of themes, mechanics, and narrative
   - Overall "fingerprint" of the game's essence
   - These will be used for similarity calculations and game blending

Remember: Focus on what made these games special in their time, not how they compare to modern standards. Celebrate their innovations and understand their limitations as part of their charm.
